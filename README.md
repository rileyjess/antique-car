# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description
This project is an employee payroll tracker that allows a user to input first name, last name, and salary data for each employee when they click the "Add Employees" button. That data is stored in the table that is displayed on the website. In the console log, the average salary of all employees and a drawing winner that has been randomly selected from the employee list are displayed. 

Acceptance Criteria:
- When the "Add employee" button is clicked, the user is presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
- When the user finishes adding an employee, they are prompted to continue or cancel
- If the user chooses to continue, they are prompted to add a new employee
- If a user chooses to cancel, their employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data

Completed Tasks:
- Added logic to collect the employee data and return an array of objects, and if a non-number value is input as the salary, the value defaults to $0
- Added logic to calculate the average of the employees' salaries and display the average in the console log
- Added logic to randomly select an employee from the array as a drawing winner
